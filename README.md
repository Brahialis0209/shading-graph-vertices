# Shading graph vertices

Shading vertices when traversing a graph in width and length

To start the application use "main" from "src"

In the same directory there is a config file where you need to fill in the data of your graph in the format:
start_node = 1 // this is the node from which the crawl begins
traversal = DFS // workaround (otherwise select BFS)
12
1 3 // further write the edges of the graph in the form of a start and end node

For example, use a ready-made graph from the config
