# Shading graph vertices

Shading vertices when traversing a graph in width and length
---
To start the application use "main" from "src".


In the same directory there is a config file where you need to fill in the data of your graph in the format:
1. start_node = 1 // this is the node from which the crawl begins
2. traversal = DFS // workaround (otherwise select BFS)
3. 1 2 // further write the edges of the graph in the form of a start and end node

For example, use a ready-made graph from the config
